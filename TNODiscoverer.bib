This paper reports a study of the apparent magnitude distribution of faint objects in the Kuiper Belt, obtained via deep imaging on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the ESO Very Large Telescope UT1. We find that the entire range of observed objects (magnitudes mR ∼ 20–27) is well represented by an unbroken power law, with the number of objects per square degree brighter than magnitude R being of the form Σ(mR < R) = 10, with α = 0.69 and R0 = 23.5. This luminosity function's slope implies a steep size distribution in the observed range, which should "roll over" to a shallower "collisional" slope once observations extend to even fainter magnitudes and thus sample bodies whose collisional ages become less than the age of the solar system. Our observations indicate the roll over is for diameters of less than 50 km, in agreement with collisional models. Modeling our survey gives a belt mass between 30 and 50 AU of order 0.1 M⊕, relatively insensitive to the roll over diameter as long as the latter is ≳1 km. We report the discovery of several objects outside of 48 AU and discuss the evidence for a sharp outer edge to the trans-Neptunian distribution.}

abstract = {The first chapter of Neural Networks, Tricks of the Trade strongly advocates the stochastic back-propagation method to train neural networks. This is in fact an instance of a more general technique called stochastic gradient descent. This chapter provides background material, explains why SGD is a good learning algorithm when the training set is large, and provides useful recommendations. This chapter appears in the “reloaded” edition of the tricks book (springer). It completes the material presented in the initial chapter "Efficient Backprop".},

 abstract = {Under normal viewing conditions we are little conscious of blur in moving objects, despite the persistence of vision. Moving objects look more blurred in brief than in long exposures, suggesting an active mechanism for suppressing motion blur. To see whether blur suppression would improve visual discrimination of objects, we measured blur discrimination thresholds for moving Gaussian-blurred edges and bars. The observer's task was to decide which of two moving stimuli, presented successively, was the more blurred. It is known that for stationary objects the just-noticeable difference in blur increases with baseline blur; therefore, if motion increases blur, it would be expected to increase the just-noticeable difference in blur. An active deblurring mechanism, on the other hand, would be expected to counteract the detrimental effects of motion blur on discrimination performance. We found, however, that motion increased thresholds for blur discrimination, both for brief (40 ms) and for longer (150 ms) exposures. We conclude that motion deblurring is a subjective effect, which does not enhance visual discrimination performance. Moving objects appear sharp, not because of some special mechanism that removes blur, but because the visual system is unable to perform the discrimination necessary to decide whether the moving object is really sharp or not.},
